/**
 * The Spartacus team is cautious with introducing style changes in a minor release, 
 * as it would conflict with the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
 * model. To improve the style layer during minor releases, without breaking the 
 * versioning, a version flag is used. The version is used to control breaking styles 
 * during the lifecycle of a major version.
 *
 * Breaking changes are added with the `forVersion()` mixin. The mixin compares the
 * from version and (optional) to version, and will only add the mixin content if changes 
 * are part of the stable release, or explicitly requested by the customer.
 *
 * An example of the usage of the mixin is given below:
 *
 * ```scss
 * @include forVersion(2.1){
 *  // valid when 2.1 is explicit requested or from 3.0 onwards
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Customers can opt-in for specific versions by declaring the `$styleVersion` variable or by
 * using the `$useLatestStyles:true` to always be up-to-date with the latest styles.

 * Examples
 * - `forVersion(2)` is valid from major version 2 onwards.
 * - `forVersion(2.1)` Valid for version 2.1 and higher, but only added as breaking change

 * - `forVersion(2, 2.1)` Valid for version 2 and 2.1. Will no longer be available after 2.1.
